# Paint online (drawing)

This is my project about collaborative drawing board. I used
<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">Node.js</a> for it.  
**Frameworks**:
- Express
- Socket.io  
**Client-server model**

---

### Run

1. Download the packages:
```
npm install
```
2. Run:
```
node server.js
```
---

By default the server runs on localhost

#### TODO:
- Load current canvas rather than white canvas when new user went to the site.
